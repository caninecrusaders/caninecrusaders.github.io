              On Wednesday, November 8, 2014, the KFHS Robotics team hosted a dinner and auction to raise both funds for this years competition season and to get information about the organization out to the public. All proceeds of the dinner auction went towards funding the team's traveling, competition, and miscellaneous expenses. Although the organization needs a rather large sum of money, a decent portion was made at Wednesday's dinner auction, where the organization made just over 9,000 dollars.

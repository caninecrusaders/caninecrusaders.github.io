Another week hard at work. Our prototyping has continued, and we have finished a
version of a ball shooter.



We have also done some work for a ball pickup system.


The CAD team have been designing the side plates for the robot. These designs
will be sent to Spokane to be "laaazer cut" (their words, not mine).

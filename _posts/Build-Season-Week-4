This week, we decided on having our team image consist of bowties. Thanks to the
PR team for thinking up three great ideas. They've also been hard at work
drawing out team standards to display our team logo. They've been playing with
many different design ideas. Thanks to Mallory Pounds for designing both of the
main ideas.

The CAD team finished the designs for side plates. We sent those designs to
Alcobra in Spokane to be laser cut.

This week, we decided on having our team image consist of bowties. Thanks to the
PR team for thinking up three great ideas. They've also been hard at work
drawing out team standards to display our team logo. They've been playing with
many different design ideas. Thanks to Mallory Pounds for designing both of the
main ideas.

The CAD team finished the designs for side plates. We sent those designs to
Alcobra Metals in Spokane to be laser cut. Now, they're working on doing the
model design for the ball shooter.

The girls of the team were in a photoshoot today to try to help promote
participation of girls in the future. We plan on placing the posters in the
Elementary and Middle schools, and we are contemplating placing them in the high
school and the district office.

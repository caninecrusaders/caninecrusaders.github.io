The Canine Crusaders are looking for new members for the 2015-16 school year. This year, our team will be utilizing an application to help get a better read on who is interested and where their interests lie. We are graduating more than 10 seniors and while we are going to really miss them, we must find new eager young robot jedi to train up! If you are a 9-12 grade student at KFHS that is interested in doing robotics, please fill out the team application. Click this [link][dropbox] and download to print. Turn the complete application in to Mrs. Naomi Edwards at KFHS by the end of Friday, May 29th. Please take the time to answer the questions thoughtfully. Essay answers are expected to be in full sentences that fully reflect YOU!

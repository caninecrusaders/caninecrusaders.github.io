Earlier this month, after our first competition at West Valley, Makayla was
approached by Spokane STEM. She wrote a blog post for them, and we couldn't be
more proud.

"Robotics has changed my life in so many ways. Chief among these is that I am
capable of doing much more than just sports.  I remember sitting in geometry as
a freshman and our teacher, which happens to be the robotics lead coach, told us
that our school would have a robotics program next year. As a three sport
varsity athlete I literally said “I would never join robotics!” That first year
the robotics team qualified for the District Championships in Portland. My
family traveled to support my brother, who was a member of the team. There I had
my first exposure to what robotics and FIRST robotics really was. The next year
I joined the team and have been in love with it ever since" <p> <p>

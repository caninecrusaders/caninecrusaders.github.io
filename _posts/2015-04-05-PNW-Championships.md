At the PNW District Championships, Team 4980 did exceptionally well! We were ranked 9th after the qualification matches and were able to become an alliance captain. We teamed up with Team 2990 and Team 4125. We were unable to move on to semifinal rounds, however; with all the points we earned, we moved up from 54th all the way up to 25th which qualified us for the 2015 FIRST World's Championships. We will be traveling April 21st and 22nd via Southwest from Spokane, WA to St. Louis, MO. We will be competing April 22nd-25th. Please watch us online and cheer us on! Thanks for your support!!
